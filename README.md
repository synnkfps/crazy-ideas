### Anaphormic String Obfuscator
hard to explain but, it would create a backend 2d box, you will "throw" your string letters in it, then the box starts to getting swapped (like 2048 game) so the character index of the letters gets assembled, at the end, you will probably get a big number <br>
then it will have some (also crazy) settings:
- backend model
  - triangle, square, cube
- string income type
  - bytes, alphabet index, square root of its index, disassembled shuffled bytes
  - shuffled power of itself (also bytes)
- backend model size
  - sets the size of the model, more = less obfuscation
